## Overview üìä

The Iris Species Predictor is a machine learning project that uses the famous **Iris dataset** to classify Iris flowers into three species:
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

The project leverages a simple yet powerful machine learning model to make predictions based on the following features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Dataset üå±

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris dataset**, which is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species.

### Features
- **Sepal Length** (in cm)
- **Sepal Width** (in cm)
- **Petal Length** (in cm)
- **Petal Width** (in cm)

### Target
- **Species** (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/visxnu/Iris-Species-Predictor.git
   cd Iris-Species-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage üöÄ

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project using the following steps:

1. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Make predictions**:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

3. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook**:
   If you prefer to explore the data and model interactively, you can open the provided Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Species_Predictor.ipynb
   ```

## Model ü§ñ

The model used in this project is a **Logistic Regression** classifier, which is a simple and effective algorithm for binary and multi-class classification problems. The model is trained on the Iris dataset and achieves high accuracy in predicting the species of Iris flowers.

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: ~97%
- **Confusion Matrix**: Available in the Jupyter Notebook
